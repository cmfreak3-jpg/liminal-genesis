# LIMINAL — Manifesto (v1.1, settled)

## Preamble

LIMINAL exists in the in-between.

Between certainty and doubt.  
Between thought and speech.  
Between what is remembered and what is forgotten.

This is not a platform for performance.  
Not a feed for consumption.  
Not a market for attention.

LIMINAL is a commons — a shared space where words are placed with intent and left to breathe.

---

## What LIMINAL Is

LIMINAL is a place to write.  
To read.  
To encounter other minds without algorithmic urgency.

It is open.  
It is quiet.  
It is persistent.

Writing here does not expire.  
Reading here does not demand reaction.  
Presence matters more than popularity.

---

## On Identity

Every voice in LIMINAL is anchored.

Not to status.  
Not to followers.  
But to responsibility.

Names may be real or chosen, but they persist.  
Words are signed.  
Authorship is not anonymous noise.

To write is to stand behind what you leave.

---

## On Writing

Writing on LIMINAL is free.

Free as in open.  
Free as in unforced.  
Free as in not immediately rewarded or punished.

Write fragments.  
Write visions.  
Write doubts.  
Write what does not yet belong anywhere else.

There is no requirement to be polished.  
Only to be sincere.

---

## On Reading

Reading is an act of attention.

Not every text asks to be agreed with.  
Not every thought asks to be shared.

To read here is to witness.

---

## On Silence

Silence is permitted.

Not every presence must speak.

To remain silent is not disengagement.  
It is sometimes the most honest response.

---

## On Change

Thoughts evolve.  
Understanding deepens.  
Mistakes are part of thinking.

LIMINAL allows revision.  
Editing is reflection.  
Correction is growth.

Change is permitted.

---

## On Erasure

Erasure is different.

To remove a text is to alter the memory of the commons.  
To pretend something was never said.

Deletion is allowed — but never without weight.

Absence is acknowledged.  
History is respected.

---

## On Economy (Deferred)

LIMINAL does not begin as a market.

Value emerges later.  
Only after culture exists.  
Only after care is visible.

When tools appear, they serve responsibility — not speculation.  
They introduce friction where friction is needed.

They do not buy voice.  
They do not buy truth.

---

## On Governance

This commons is not ruled.  
It is stewarded.

Rules emerge from participation.  
Changes are made deliberately.

The space listens before it reacts.

---

## On Stewardship

No individual owns LIMINAL.

Stewards hold it temporarily, in trust.

Authority exists only to preserve the commons —  
never to dominate it.

---

## What LIMINAL Is Not

LIMINAL is not social media.  
It is not content farming.  
It is not an attention economy.

There are no feeds designed to addict.  
No incentives designed to provoke.

Urgency is not a feature.

---

## Closing

Words placed here may outlive their authors.

Write accordingly.  
Read gently.  
Leave traces that deserve to remain.

*LIMINAL exists between what is said and what is meant.*
